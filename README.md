# Celebal-week-4


## Topic
Conduct an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis on a complex dataset. Focus on understanding data distributions, identifying missing values, detecting outliers, and uncovering relationships between variables. Utilize visualizations like histograms, box plots, and heatmaps to support your findings.

## Assignment Description
This assignment performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, aiming to uncover key insights about passenger survival using visualizations, statistical summaries, and data preprocessing.

## Libraries Used
1. matplotlib.pyplot: For creating static, animated, and interactive plots.
2. pandas: For data manipulation and analysis (used later in the notebook).
3. seaborn: For creating advanced statistical visualizations with built-in themes and color palettes.

## Assignment Structure

Section : Description 
1. Dataset Overview : Load dataset, inspect shape and preview rows 
2. Dataset Summary : Generate statistical descriptions and data types 
3. Missing Value Analysis : Count missing
4. Univariate Analysis : Analyze distributions of variables like Age, Sex, Fare, Pclass 
5. Outlier Detection : Identify outliers in numerical features using boxplots 
6. Bivariate Analysis : Analyze relationships (e.g. Survived vs Age, Pclass, Fare) 
7. Categorical Feature Analysis : Impact of features like Embarked on survival 
8. Handling Missing Values : Imputation strategies (median, mode)
